Our project focuses on revolutionizing parking management by implementing a real-time availability system. It utilizes IoT sensors and intuitive screens at parking entrances to provide instant updates on slot availability. This enhances user convenience with clear displaying color-coded indicators for easy navigation. 
The system is scalable across different parking facilities and introduces revenue opportunities through advertising on entrance screens, marking a significant advancement in urban mobilityÂ solutions.An IoT-based parking availability system uses sensors and connectivity to monitor and report real-time parking space status.
